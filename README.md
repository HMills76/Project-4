# Proposal
The goal of our project is to identify patterns in the housing market and develop a model to predict house prices. Our data set includes lot size, location (city & state), number of beds and baths, and other factors that could affect property prices. Initially we were going to look at one state within our data set, however, we uncovered a way to predict pricing across multiple areas within North America.
