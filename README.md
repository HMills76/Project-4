# Proposal
The goal of our project is to identify patterns in the housing market and develop a model to predict house prices. Our data set includes lot size, location (city & state), number of beds and baths, and other factors that could affect property prices. Initially we were going to look at one state within our data set, however, we uncovered a way to predict pricing across multiple areas within North America.

# Other Models
Included within our repository is Test_Random_Forest_Model - Project_4_RF ALL.ipynb . Our accuracy score was actually higher than it was in the linear regression model, however, due to our group understanding the linear regression theory better and the time constraints we were up against, we knew we could better speak to the linear regression model. If we had more time, we would have done additional research and presented on both.
